I am an undergraduate student at Nanyang Technological University, pursuing a double bachelor's in Computer Science and Business. 

Currently, I'm working on these projects:

- **[SOPPU](https://github.com/YashJain14/SOPPU)**: Building a decentralized LLM inference system for scalable personalized AI by compressing LoRA adapters
